## Twitch dmenu

This is a python script to select a twitch stream to view with livestreamer using dmenu. You don't even need a browser to see what's streaming anymore!

Requires both livestreamer and dmenu to be installed

Doesn't have good support for going back in the menus or canceling.

##### Planned features
- Better (d)menu navigation
